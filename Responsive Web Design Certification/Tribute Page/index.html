        <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Iverson's life:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>1975</strong> - Born in Hampton, Virginia to a single
            15-year-old mother, Ann Iverson, and was given his mother's maiden
            name after his father Allen Broughton left her.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1992</strong> - Iverson played for the Boo Williams AAU
            basketball team and won the 1992 17-and-under AAU national
            championship.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1993</strong> - Iverson and several of his friends were
            involved in an altercation with several other patrons at a bowling
            alley in Hampton, Virginia.[16] Allegedly, Iverson's crowd was
            raucous and had to be asked to quiet down several times, and
            eventually, a shouting duel began with another group of youths.
            Shortly after that, a fight erupted, pitting the white crowd against
            the black crowd. Also, a videotape surfaced of the incident that
            shows Iverson leaving shortly after the fighting began. After
            Iverson spent four months at Newport News City Farm, a correctional
            facility in Newport News, he was granted clemency by Virginia
            Governor Douglas Wilder, and the Virginia Court of Appeals
            eventually overturned the conviction in 1995 for insufficient
            evidence. The prison sentence forced him to complete his senior year
            of high school at Richard Milburn High School, a school for at-risk
            students, instead of competing in sports at Bethel.[17] However, the
            three years Iverson spent at Bethel were enough to convince
            Georgetown University head coach John Thompson to come out and meet
            Iverson, and offer him a full scholarship to join the Georgetown
            Hoyas basketball team.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1994</strong> - In his first season at Georgetown in
            1994–95, Iverson won the Big East Rookie of the Year award and was
            named to the All Rookie Tournament First Team.[18] That season,
            Iverson led the Hoyas to the Sweet 16 round of the NCAA tournament,
            where they lost to the North Carolina Tar Heels.[19] In his second
            and final season at Georgetown in 1995–96, Iverson led the team to a
            Big East championship and all the way to the Elite Eight round of
            the NCAA tournament, where they lost to the Massachusetts
            Minutemen.[20] He ended his college career as the Hoyas' all-time
            leader in career scoring average, at 22.9 points per game.[7]
            Iverson was named as a first-team All-American.[21] Iverson was also
            named the Big East Defensive Player of the Year in each of his two
            seasons at Georgetown.[22] Following his sophomore year, Iverson
            declared for the 1996 NBA draft. He was the first player under Coach
            Thompson to leave Georgetown early for the NBA.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1996</strong> - After two seasons at Georgetown, Iverson was
            selected with the 1st overall pick in the 1996 NBA draft to the
            Philadelphia 76ers. Listed at 6 ft 0 in (1.83 m) tall, he became the
            shortest first overall pick ever, in a league normally dominated by
            taller players. The lockout-shortened 1998–1999 season would mark
            great improvement for the 76ers. Iverson averaged 26.8 points (which
            led the league, earning his first scoring title) and was named to
            his first All NBA first team. The Sixers finished the season at
            28–22, earning Iverson his first trip to the playoffs.[30] He
            started all ten playoff games and averaged 28.5 points per game
            despite being hampered by a number of nagging injuries. Iverson led
            the Sixers to an upset over the number three seeded Orlando Magic in
            four games, before losing to the Indiana Pacers in the second round
            in six games.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2000</strong> - During the 2000–01 season, Iverson led his
            team to a franchise record 10–0 start to the season, and was named a
            starter at the 2001 NBA All-Star Game, where he won the game MVP.
            The Sixers posted a 56–26 record on the year, the best in the
            Eastern Conference that season, earning the top seed. He also
            averaged a then-career-high 31.1 points, winning his second NBA
            scoring title in the process. Iverson won the NBA steals title at
            2.5 a game. Iverson was named NBA Most Valuable Player; at 6 feet
            and 165 pounds, he became the shortest and lightest player to win
            the MVP award. He had 93 first-place votes out of a possible
            124.[36] He was also named to the All NBA First team for his
            accomplishments. In the playoffs, Iverson and the Sixers defeated
            the Indiana Pacers in the first round, before meeting Vince
            Carter-led Toronto Raptors in the Eastern Semifinals. The series
            went the full seven games. In the next round, the Sixers defeated
            the Milwaukee Bucks, also in seven games, to advance to the 2001 NBA
            Finals against the defending champion Los Angeles Lakers, featuring
            the duo of Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal. Iverson led the Sixers
            to their first finals since their 1983 championship. In game one of
            the 2001 NBA Finals, Iverson scored a playoff-high 48 points and
            beat the heavily favored Lakers 107–101; it was the Lakers' only
            playoff loss that year. In the game, he notably stepped over Tyronn
            Lue after hitting a crucial shot.[37] Iverson would go on to score
            23, 35, 35, and 37 in games 2–5, all losing efforts though the
            Sixers were not swept like many predicted. Iverson enjoyed his most
            successful season as an individual and as a member of the Sixers
            during the 2000–01 NBA season.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2013</strong> - In January 2013, Iverson received an offer
            to play for the Texas Legends of the NBA D-League, but he
            declined.[96] On October 30, 2013, Iverson announced his retirement
            from basketball, citing he lost his desire to play.[97][98] At the
            76ers 2013–14 season home opener that night, he received a standing
            ovation at the beginning of the second quarter. The news conference
            at which he announced his retirement was attended by former
            Georgetown coach John Thompson and Sixers great Julius Erving.[99]
            Iverson said he would always be a Sixer "until I die," and that
            while he always thought the day he retired would be a "tough" day,
            he instead stated it was rather a "happy" day.[98] In November 2013,
            the 76ers announced that they would officially retire Iverson's
            number 3 in a special halftime ceremony on March 1, 2014, when the
            Sixers hosted the Washington Wizards.[100][101] The ceremony took
            place in front of 20,000 spectators and 76ers greats such as Julius
            Erving, Moses Malone, and former team president Pat Croce.[102] He
            headlined the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame Class of
            2016 along with Shaquille O'Neal and Yao Ming. Iverson highlighted
            John Thompson and Larry Brown when speaking to the media on who he
            credited for a Hall of Fame career.
